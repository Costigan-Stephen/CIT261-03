		<h4>Melissa Holland's Semester Experience Summary:</h4><br>
		<p>I was able to learn a lot this semester about what coding in the real world would be like.<br>
		I learned how much it is required to teach yourself in the coding field through research and the internet.<br>
		I also learned how to be a better teacher as we had to present each week. I would say that my understand of<br>
		Javascript and CSS were the areas that were most improved. I had awesome teammates who really taught me a lot<br>
		through their coding experience which was super helpful to me this semester.</p>
