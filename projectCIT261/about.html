		<div><h4>Melissa Holland's Semester Experience Summary:</h4>
		<p>I was able to learn a lot this semester about what coding in the real world would be like.
		I learned how much it is required to teach yourself in the coding field through research and the 
        internet.</p>
        <p>I also learned how to be a better teacher as we had to present each week. I would say that my 
        understanding of Javascript and CSS were the areas that were most improved. I had awesome 
        teammates who really taught me a lot through their coding experience which was super helpful to 
        me this semester.</p></div><br><br>
		<div><h4>Stephen Costigan's Semester Experience Summary:</h4>
		<p>I think this semester was a good one for learning.  I only had a basic grasp on CSS/JSON 		
        coming into the semester and so was able to benefit from the understanding of my classmates.</p>
        <p>This project began as a more ambitious affair, but after losing Julio, who was our guy for
        SQL incorporation, we had to take a hard look at our project.  Missy had done PHP in the past,
        but this was too much for us to make happen and so had to simplify the entire thing.</p>
        <p>I think this was a positive thing in the end.  Sometimes, you have to understand your own
        limitations and work within your abilities.  Since neither of us was able to properly secure the
        assignment with encryption, we had to completely put it aside and work on what the semester 
        covered.</p>
        <p>All things considered, it was a great semester for learning.</p></div>
