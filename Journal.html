					</header>
					<p>I'm not sure how this smester will pan out, but I certainly am not typically a fan of group projects.  I'm hoping this semester will prove me a skeptic, but generally speaking they always end up with me doing a majority of the work and one or two members completely disappearing at the end when they are needed the most.  My first meeting with my group members was positive, but it's too soon to know whether or not this will remain the case.  Julio has taken this class before, but had to leave due to personal reasons so he may be useful in the future, and Missy has some great CSS skills that will make our end of semester group project go well.</p>
                    <p>We set up a good plan to teach all of the lessons before week 10, which was based on my suggestion of teaching two a week for a few weeks and then one a week for the remainder of the weeks.  If we can keep this plan we should be able to get all of the lessons done by week 10 and then work on our group project that is due at the end of the semester.</p>

						<p>The Stress is KILLING me</p>
					</header>
					<p>It's always fun to work on big assignments, isn't it?  Even moreso when you realized you had no idea it was something that had to be done.</p>
					
					<p>It turns out that the documents we were supposed to submit for competency were not the only measure of competency we were supposed to submit.  I learned after submitting the documents in bulk that there had to be a website made for the assignments.  You are currently reading this on that website, but at the start of the week this was not known to me.  Needless to say, I did not sleep much this week.  I took time off work and spent 3 solid days doing nothing but this.  The end result turned out pretty good in my opinion, but it was a very long and stressful process that almost drove me to illness.</p>
					
					<p>It wouldn't have been so bad had my group members known about it, but none of us seemed to have known about it and so our group meeting this week was hurried as we all worked to get it done.  This, looking back, was one of the last times we heard from Julio.  My guess is that he decided to work toward the C competency, but our group project suffered as a result of his absence.</p>

						<h2>Week 11</h2>
						<p>A major brush with death</p>
					</header>
					<p>Unfortunately, I was not able to work on much this week as I spent much of it sick or in hospital.  I came down with what I thought was a stomach bug on wednesday early morning (2am) and spent the entire night with pain in my stomach that I had assumed to be a stomach bug.  I had assumed this as my inlaws, who we spend a lot of time with, had all recently overcome a stomach bug and figured it was just my turn to get it.  Turns out I could not have been more wrong.  I spent the entire day too sick to really get anything done and spent time under blankets with a heating pad.  It was strange though, I couldn't seem to shake the chills despite my many layers and my wife worried that I might have come down with the flu (again).  At the end of a long and painful day in which I didn't get a lot done, I went to bed and covered myself in blankets, but could not get warm.  From there, my recolection ends and my wife's retelling needs to be called upon for reference.  To make things easier for my extensive family in Australia, she sent a group message with her retelling of what happened.  These are her words:</p>

<p>"Steve had been sick to his stomach all day on Thursday. My parents and sister have had a stomach virus, so we just assumed that Steve had caught it.  He hung around the house all day with a heating pad on his belly and around midnight we went to bed. He had gotten the chills by that point so he put on his fluffy robe and I put an extra blanket on him. About 30 minutes later he leapt out of bed and tore his robe off, then jumped onto my side of the bed and sat at the foot. He seemed panicked and kept saying over and over again, "But it's not going to work." I assumed he was talking in his sleep, which isn't unusual, so I told him that everything was fine and that we would fix it in the morning. Usually that appeases him and he falls right back asleep, but not tonight. He kept repeating the same phrase, and I got this horrible feeling that something was really wrong. So I told him to stay put, and I went 
into the other room to call my parents. </p>

<p>For those of you who don't know, we live in a small apartment above their garage, so they were just right across the driveway. I got ahold of my dad and managed to say "We need help" before I just started crying. They came over and by that time I had been able to get Steve almost into our living room.  At that point he was very confused and unsteady on his feet, but he was able to remember my name and that we were supposed to have gone to the temple that night. My mom and I sat him on our couch and I dressed him for the hospital, but as I did this he forgot who I was. I had been asking him every few minutes to tell me my name, and this time he couldn't answer. I asked him where he was, and he couldn't answer. I asked him who he was, and he couldn't answer. We took his temperature and it was 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41.1 degrees Celsius). We started trying to cool him down. I took everything out of my freezer and placed it on his body, but before he had a chance to cool off he had a seizure. It started with rapid blinking of the eyes, then rapid nodding of the head, then it made its way down his body. </p>

<p>A few minutes passed and the seizure turned into a fit of rage. He screamed and stomped on the floor and grabbed things from around the room and attempted to harm himself. I jumped on him and managed to wrestle everything from his hands. Soon he tired out and collapsed on the couch. He was sitting up and staring straight ahead, his eyes so dilated that they were just black. He wouldn't respond to words, or his name, or even touch. He was awake and breathing, but Steve was just not there. For me, this was the worst part. Finally the ambulance arrived, but we had to wait on the fire department as well so that we could safely move him down the stairs. Before they moved him, I grabbed the sides of his head and placed my forehead against his. I told him, "I love you, and I need you to come back to me." For a moment, the right side of his mouth quirked up into a smile. It was gone in a second, but it was enough to give me hope that he was still in there somewhere. </p>

<p>We eventually got him into the ambulance and they were able to stabilize him. He finally began to come back to himself, and when I was allowed into the ambulance with him, he smiled at me and said "Hey, Rach." I was a mix between furious with him and the most overwhelming sense of relief. I rode with him to
the hospital, and after a lot of waiting, they discovered that his appendix was infected and had been leaking. He was in septic shock and his kidneys had begun to fail. His appendix was near bursting, so they rushed him into surgery and around 7:00 am Friday morning. [...] </p>

<p>The surgeon came in and spoke to us just a minute ago. He had three other appendectomies today and said that Steve was by far the worst case. He noted how amazing it was that you could become so sick in just 24 hours. I commented that it was crazy to me that he was just kind of sick to his stomach one moment, and then he seemed to be dying in front of me the next. The surgeon looked at me and said, "Listen to me. He was." And then of course the waterworks started all over again. It has been a day of tears, that's for sure. But we have been incredibly watched over and blessed throughout this ordeal, and I know it is because of the love and prayers of such an amazing family. Steve is going to be just fine now. He's awake and talking and says hello and sends his love to 
you all"</p>

						<h2>Week 12</h2>
						<p>Making compromises</p>
					</header>
					<p>It wasn't until Tuesday that I was effectively clear of the hospital, but I was far from back on my feet.  I reached out to my group members, which currently just consists of Missy, and we briefly made plans and arrangements for our impending deadline and the work that we needed to do for it.  I also set out to learn more about PHP as this would be necessary to incorporate SQL into our database</p>	
					<p>This was a challenge as we had initially given that charge to Julio, who had broad experience with such things, but had not heard from him in a long time, despite our best efforts.  The last time we heard anything from him was March 20, but he hadn't been to a meeting in longer than that.  His Dad was sick last we heard, but no effort has been made beyond that to reach out to us.</p>
					
					<p>So, naturally, this resulted in myself taking the reins of the SQL integration with PHP.  I have never actually personally used PHP and so spent the week learning all about it and hoping that it would work out.  It has to, really, we don't have any other options at this point.</p>

						<h2>Week 13</h2>
						<p>Crunch Time</p>
					</header>
					<p>Some weeks are stressful because there is a lot of work, others are stressful because the teammate you had planned to do a particular function went MIA.  This was a case of the latter.  We, as a group, had planned an ambitious project with the assumption that our team member would perform PHP scripts that would tie in the SQL database to the project.  This turned out not to be.</p>
                    <p>As a result, I started the week thinking I would take up this slack.  I was mistaken it seems.  I had never done more in PHP than a simple 'hello world' document, but thought my background in JS and HTML would carry me over.  PHP was a different animal and I was not prepared for the steep learning curve that it required.  After spending all of monday trying to make simple actions happen, I confided in my remaining group member and found that she had some PHP knowledge behind her.</p>
					<p>So, after a lengthy talk, we decided she would take that project and I would build our HTML backbone and CSS groundwork.  It seemed this was going to work, but it seemed her PHP knowledge was not able to be applied to our situation and so we had to completely scrap the entire thing.  We then tried to use an external JSON document until we realized that JavaScript does not like to read files that are not hosted.  In the end, we had to gut a lot of our project and rested on LocalStorage in the end to make it work.  Let's just hope we can make it work in time.</p>
